# AI Fashion Recommender

An intelligent fashion recommendation system that uses OpenAI's CLIP model to match clothing items with natural language descriptions. Simply describe what you want to wear, and the AI will find the best matching outfits from your wardrobe!

## Features

- **Natural Language Search**: Search with phrases like "casual brunch outfit" or "formal business meeting"
- **Visual Results**: See your top matching clothing items with similarity scores
- **Smart Matching**: Uses CLIP's advanced image-text understanding trained on 400M+ examples
- **Easy Setup**: Just add photos of your clothes and start searching!

## ML Design

The system combines two powerful AI components:

1. **Text Encoder**: Converts your search query into a "style vector" that captures meaning
2. **Image Encoder**: Converts clothing photos into "visual vectors" that represent their appearance
3. **Similarity Matching**: Finds images whose vectors are most similar to your query vector

Built on OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model.
